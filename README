		README for vms-empire

VMS-Empire is a simulation of a full-scale war between two
emperors, the computer and you.  Naturally, there is only
room for one, so the object of the game is to destroy
the other.  The computer plays by the same rules that you
do.  This game is the ancestor of all the multiplayer 4X
simulations out there, including Civilization and Master of Orion.

This code originated under VMS but has been forward-ported to
modern ANSI C.  It is known to run not only on Linux but
also under Windows and Mac OS X; all you need is a local
port of the curses library.

The files HACKING and BUGS will be of interest if you intend
to modify this code.

The ancestral code was by Chuck Simmons <chuck@amdahl.com>.  Since
around 1990 it has been maintained by Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>
