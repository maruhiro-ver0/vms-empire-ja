attack.c -- handle an attack between two pieces.  We do everything from
fighting it out between the pieces to notifying the user who won and
killing off the losing object.  Somewhere far above, our caller is
responsible for actually removing the object from its list and actually
updating the player's view of the world.

Find object being attacked.  If it is a city, attacker has 50% chance
of taking city.  If successful, give city to attacker.  Otherwise
kill attacking piece.  Tell user who won.

If attacking object is not a city, loop.  On each iteration, select one
piece to throw a blow.  Damage the opponent by the strength of the blow
thrower.  Stop looping when one object has 0 or fewer hits.  Kill off 
the dead object.  Tell user who won and how many hits her piece has left,
if any.
